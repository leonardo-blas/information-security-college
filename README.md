# information-security-college
One of my college classes on information security. Most of the labs come from SEED Labs.
Since information security is more about events, situations, and actions, projects are best recorded as reports rather than code.

## BGP exploration and attack
My final project was to complete the SEED Labs' BGP exploration and attack lab.
Just a heads up, during my presentation I look and sound very robotic, but this is because I could be downgraded for things like saying "uhm" or taking over 5 minutes!
