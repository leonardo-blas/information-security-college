# information-security-college
One of my college classes on information security. Most of the labs come from SEED Labs.

## BGP exploration and attack
My final project was to complete the SEED Labs' BGP exploration and attack lab.

I sound robotic because I could be downgraded for saying "uhm," not being straightforward, or taking over 5 minutes!
